  \item 
    Setup Eclipse, Eclim, and Vim to work together;
  \item

\begin{itemize}

  \item
    Setup debugging to run on real Android device;
  \item
    Created a simple gallery following a tutorial at \href{http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-gallery.html}{Android Developers};
  \item
    Created a simple drawing demo without the use of tutorials to learn and use the api;
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Vim was not providing enough support for programming the application so I have moved to using Eclipse with Vim embedded in it;
\end{itemize}

\section*{2012-05-17}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Created an about screen;
  \item
    Began loading images from the gallery application, will extend this to request pictures from camera as well which is a relatively simple addition;
  \item
    Cleaned up code and refactored to be more in line with what should be used in the project;
\end{itemize}

  \item
    Setup selection to scale and center to screen size;
  \item
    Learned how to use the, sanity-saving, debugger;

\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Working with matrix transformations has been a day-long adventure/headache but I'm getting the hang of them;
\end{itemize}

\section*{2012-05-22}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    Refactored code to be more readable, scale images properly, seperate neghbourhoods and images into seperate classes and handle rotated images;
  \item
    Rotation is now read from the picture attributes to handle portrait photos;
  \item
    Neighbourhoods now draw after from their own class;
  \item
    Can now move neighbourhood properly by tracking touch events;
  \item
    Moving the neighbourhood is constrained to the image;
\end{itemize}
\subsestion*{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    Working between scales can be quite a challenge, but is neccessary to scale and pan the image properly;
\end{itemize}
